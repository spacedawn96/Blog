        Upon graduating with honors from the Art Center College of Design, Eric Robison
        <br />
        began his career as an artist when he was hired by Walt Disney Imagineering. As a{' '}
        <br />
        concept designer, he worked on projects associated with Disneyland Resort Paris,{' '}
        <br />
        Disneyland Resort Tokyo, Walt Disney World Resort, and of course, Disneyland{' '}
        <br />
        Resort California. His unique paintings of the classic Disney characters were{' '}
        <br />
        discovered by Imagineering President, Marty Sklar, and the rest as they say is{' '}
        <br />
        history. Since then, he has become a best-selling artist in Disney’s theme parks,{' '}
        <br />
        galleries, and stores. Some highlights of his Disney pieces include the 30th{' '}
        <br />
        Anniversary of the Haunted Mansion, Disney Decades for Disneyland’s 50th <br />
        Anniversary, The Pirates of the Caribbean, The Matterhorn painting [tribute to{' '}
        <br />
        Herbie Ryman], and The original Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. Besides the Walt{' '}
        <br />
        Disney Company, Eric has also worked as a consultant for Universal Studios and{' '}
        <br />
        Warner Bros. His list of credits also includes the Vans World Cup of Surfing in{' '}
        <br />
        Hawaii, NASA, and more. In 2001, Eric was commissioned by Disneyland to create 100{' '}
        <br />
        Mickey Mouse portraits for Disneyland’s 100th birthday of Walt. This exhibit{' '}
        <br />
        opened in 2002 and sold out in 3 weeks. Following up on the 100 Mickeys’ success{' '}
        <br />
        was his interpretations of 50 Donald Ducks for the grand opening of the New York{' '}
        <br />
        Disney store on 5th Avenue. Eric’s latest Disney project has been the 5th <br />
        Anniversary painting for the Disney Aulani Resort in Hawaii. He works out of two{' '}
        <br />
        studios; one in Hawaii and the other in the French West Indies. His fine art{' '}
        <br />
        expressionistic pieces have found international attention in France, Asia, <br />
        Indonesia, Germany, and Los Angeles. In addition to his world-renowned art, Eric{' '}
        <br />
        is President and CEO of Imagiboom Entertainment LLC in Hawaii. In 2019, Eric{' '}
        <br />
        directed, wrote, and created all the visuals for his short film, The Hollow Moon.{' '}
        <br />
        For this experimental film, he painted over 400 originals scenes that were blended{' '}
        <br />
        with stop motion and experimental movements in animation. In 2019, The Hollow Moon{' '}
        <br />
        won 12 awards internationally for Best Experimental Film.{' '}
